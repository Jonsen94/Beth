Be genuine: Be sincere and authentic in your approach, and try to show genuine interest in the other person. This can help the conversation feel more natural and comfortable for both of you.

Use positive body language: Make eye contact, smile, and use open body language (e.g. uncrossed arms) to signal that you're approachable and friendly.

Avoid controversial topics: Try to steer clear of potentially controversial topics, at least at first, to avoid making the other person uncomfortable.

Here are some example phrases you could use to start a conversation:
