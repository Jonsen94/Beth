<br/>

- [ ] ~~Take a guided tour of Fenway Park~~ (needs to be booked)
- [ ] ~~Visit the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum~~ (still hand planned day)
- [X] Grab dinner in the North End (already done yesterday)

## Using Beth with some problems
- Same problems as yesterday: still no internet connection
- did parts of the freedom trail as planned earlier
- probably changing the way of how to use beth: instead of preplanning everything just getting input
