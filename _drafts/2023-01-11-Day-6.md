## What was planned

- Xmas gift: donut tour in the morning
- Finding a place with internet and power to communicate with beth and write the blog

## What happened
- Nice 2 hour donut tour as breakfast
- Saw some cool places and got some more history and stories of boston from our tour guide
- Fun fact: Boston is the city with the most donut shops per capital in the USA. Roughly 1 per 10000 capitals (number found only diverges a bit from the tours information)
- Favorite donut of the tour: maple bacon
- Afterwards went to the boston public library
- huge and beautiful building with good places to sit, free and working wifi and power
- Some story writing and book reading later found a brewery tour for the evening
- directly booked it and went there by foot
- Tour through the Samuel Adams Brewery was nice, got some beer and some cool information
- Still need to try the beer/wine brew they have, but that was left for another day

## Recap
- found a place to sit and write this blog and to plan the day
- beth is working mostly but differently than planned earlier, got some more ideas which need to be checked when there is time again
- Beth decided not to help me with "plattdeutsch" nor with ascii art
