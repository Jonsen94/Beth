## A story of beth
- It was planned to use beth as a day planner
- Sadly cause of connectivity issues I couldn't use beth as wished
- Also the preparation time was too short as the idea using beth as a guide trip was to spontaneous
- So until the 11.01. all days were "planned" by hand with just some ideas and input from beths planning

Use your own words.

First day summary:
- Explored the neighborhood by foot
- Went into the town strolling around 
- Saw parts of Harvard and MIT
- Checked some parts and got familiar with the city and underground train
- Ate in the north end, bostons little italy

## Summary
Op mijn eerste volledige dag in Boston heb ik de buurt te voet verkend. Verder ben ik door de stad gelopen en heb ik delen van Harvard en MIT gezien. Ook ben ik bekend geworden met de stad en de metro. Ten slotte heb ik in de North End, Boston's kleine ItaliÃ«, gegeten.

Het was een geweldige eerste dag in Boston. Ik kan niet wachten om te zien wat de rest van mijn reis in petto heeft.

## Song of the day

## Movie of the day
_Good Will Hunting_

## Pun of the day

Why was the math book sad? Because it had too many problems.
