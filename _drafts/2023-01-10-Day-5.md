## What was planned

As stated earlier: currently Beth is not used for full day planning but just for ideas.
For today I planned to finish the Freedom Trail and booked a Harvard Tour (as recommended by Beth)

## What happened
- Harvard Tour in the morning
- Small but with some funny facts about Harvard
- No looks into the buildings but just a bit of story time and harvard history
- Afterwards I went to finish the freedom trail
- Got some more ideas of what to do: visit the USS constitutional (also recommended by Beth) and other museums which were on the trail
- In the evening: drinking a beer with my new friend from the flight, sharing some stories and first expressions
