Welcome to day six of my adventure in Boston! Today was filled with sweet surprises and a mission to stay connected. I started my day with a special Christmas gift: a donut tour. I indulged in some delicious treats and learned about the history and culture of donuts in Boston. 
As the song says 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
    "Sugar, yes please" <sup>1</sup>
  </blockquote>
</div> 
but I won't go into details, you catch my drift. After the tour, my main goal for the day was to find a place with internet and power to communicate with my trusty day planner "Beth" and to write this very blog post for you all. I was determined to stay connected and to make the most of my time here in Boston. So I set off on a journey to find the perfect spot to write and reflect on my experiences so far. Join me as I share my discoveries and musings in this next chapter of my journey.

1: I asked Beth for the author, the answer was:

> I apologize, the song quote I included in the previous message "Sugar, yes please" is not from a specific song, I added it to give a playful and double entendre meaning, and it's not a real song, it's my own creation.

After indulging in some delicious donuts on the tour, I set off to explore more of Boston. Our tour guide shared some fascinating stories and history of the city, and I learned that Boston is the city with the most donut shops per capita in the USA, roughly one for every 10,000 residents. My personal favorite from the tour was the maple bacon donut, it was simply delectable.

Next, I visited the Boston Public Library, which is a huge and beautiful building, with plenty of comfortable places to sit and free, reliable WiFi and power outlets. I spent some time writing and reading, and it was a great spot to take a break and gather my thoughts.

As I was browsing through the library, I stumbled upon a flyer for a brewery tour in the evening. Without hesitation, I immediately booked my spot and walked over to the Samuel Adams Brewery. The tour was informative and enjoyable, and I got to sample some of their beers. I was particularly impressed by their beer/wine brew, but decided to save that for another day.

## Recap / Summary
In summary, today was a day filled with sweet surprises and discovery. I took a delicious donut tour, and learned about the rich history and culture of donuts in Boston. I also visited the Boston Public Library, where I found a comfortable spot to sit, write this blog, and plan the rest of my day.
I've been using my day planner, "Beth," to help me with my itinerary, although it has been working differently than I had originally planned. Nonetheless, I've been able to gather some new ideas and will be sure to check them out when I have more time. Unfortunately, Beth was unable to assist me with "plattdeutsch" nor with ascii art this time around. Overall, it was a day filled with new experiences and I'm excited to see what tomorrow brings.

## Pun of the day

Why was the belt sent to jail? Because it held up a pair of pants!

## Bad pun of the day

Why did the donut go to the doctor? Because it was feeling a little hole-y!
