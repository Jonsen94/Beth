## What was planned

I had planned to use "Beth" as my day planner for my trip, but unfortunately due to connectivity issues, I was unable to utilize it as much as I had hoped. Despite this setback, I decided to still take some of the ideas and recommendations from Beth for my planning. For today, I had planned to finish the Freedom Trail and also booked a tour of Harvard, as Beth had suggested. I was excited to dive deeper into the history and culture of Boston and to explore more of the city's iconic landmarks.

## What happened
My dear King,

I hope this letter finds you well. I have been spending my days in the colony of Boston, and I must say, it is quite the fascinating place. Today, I had the pleasure of taking a tour of Harvard in the morning. Though the tour was small, it was filled with some amusing facts about the esteemed institution. While we were not able to venture inside the buildings, the tour guide shared some intriguing stories and history of Harvard.

After the tour, I set off to complete the Freedom Trail. It was a journey through the city's rich history and a reminder of the importance of our fight for freedom. Along the way, I gained some new ideas for future excursions, such as visiting the USS Constitution and other museums that were on the trail.

As the evening approached, I had the pleasure of sharing a beer with a new friend I met on my flight here. We shared stories and exchanged our initial impressions of this grand city. It was a delightful way to end the day and I am looking forward to see what tomorrow brings.

I trust that all is well on your end and that our cause is progressing. I shall keep you informed of my observations and experiences here in the colonies.

Yours truly,<br>
Jonas

## Summary
In short, the day was filled with excitement, some challenges, but also some victory and triumph. Some moments may require a comeback, others the feeling of being on top of the world, but all in all the day was filled with a lot of experiences and emotions, and it all goes by fast, so it's important to take a moment to enjoy and look around. And, of course, some moments of reflection and contemplation were shared with a companion.

## Pun of the day

Why was the history book sad? Because it had too many chapters.
