## Using Beth with some problems
It was initially planned to use "Beth" as my day planner for my trip, but unfortunately due to connectivity issues, I was unable to utilize it as much as I had hoped. This was a real shame as I was really looking forward to using it as a guide throughout my trip. To make matters worse, the preparation time before my trip was quite short, and the idea of using Beth as a guide was quite spontaneous. As a result, I found myself "planning" each day by hand, using just some ideas and input from Beth's previous planning.
Until the 11.01, all days were planned in this fashion and I had to go with the flow of the trip with just some general idea of what to do without a strict schedule.
It was a bit disappointing that I was unable to fully utilize Beth as a planner, but I'm still making the most of my trip and finding new and exciting things to do every day.

## What happened
Today was an amazing first full day in Boston! I started by exploring the neighborhood on foot, getting a feel for the bustling streets and charming buildings. As I walked, I couldn't help but think of a quote from the movie 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
    "Boston is a great city. You know why? 'Cause the people here are...they're not just people, they're Boston people." - "Good Will Hunting"
  </blockquote>
</div>
And it's true, there's something special about the energy here.

As I walked further into the town, I couldn't help but be struck by the stunning architecture of the buildings, both old and new. I saw parts of Harvard and MIT, which was truly awe-inspiring. 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
    "I want to know God's thoughts; the rest are details." - Albert Einstein
  </blockquote>
</div>
Walking through these institutions, it was clear that the brilliant minds here have been and continue to be on the forefront of human progress and discovery.

As I explored the city, I also made sure to familiarize myself with the public transportation system, including the underground train. I must admit, it was confusing at first, but soon I got the hang of it and moving around the city got much easier. There is a famous quote from the famous politician: 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
    "Boston is not just a capital, but the intellectual capital of the world"
  </blockquote>
</div> 
It is true to every extent.

Finally, I ended my day with a delicious meal in the north end, also known as Boston's little Italy. The food was amazing, and the atmosphere was lively and inviting.

    "I love to go to a restaurant and eat the food of a country where I would not want to live." - Groucho Marx   
  </blockquote>
</div>
I couldn't agree more. The culture and spirit of the north end were truly unforgettable.

Overall, it was an incredible first day in Boston. I can't wait to see what the rest of my trip has in store.

## Summary
Op mijn eerste volledige dag in Boston heb ik de buurt te voet verkend. Verder ben ik door de stad gelopen en heb ik delen van Harvard en MIT gezien. Ook ben ik bekend geworden met de stad en de metro. Ten slotte heb ik in de North End, Boston's kleine ItaliÃ«, gegeten.

Het was een geweldige eerste dag in Boston. Ik kan niet wachten om te zien wat de rest van mijn reis in petto heeft.
