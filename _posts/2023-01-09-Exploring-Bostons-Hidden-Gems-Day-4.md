## What happened
It was another wonderful day of exploring Boston, but with a bit of a twist. I had planned to use "Beth" as my day planner, but due to connectivity issues, I was unable to fully utilize it as I had hoped. But I refused to let this setback ruin my day, I decided to follow the flow and go with the wind, as the famous song says " Don't stop believin' hold on to that feeling"

I started off by strolling around the city, taking in the sights and sounds. Along the way, I stumbled upon a charming diner and decided to stop for breakfast. The menu had some interesting options that caught my attention and made me curious, it was tempting and I couldn't resist. "I'm on a rollercoaster that only goes up, my head is spinning round and round" as the song goes.

After breakfast, I set off to visit Boston commons and other parks. The beauty of the greenery and the tranquility of the space amidst the bustling city was breathtaking. It was a good place for a little walk, and I was tempted to take some shortcuts and explore some hidden paths.

I then followed the first part of the Freedom Trail with an audio guide. I was mesmerized by the rich history of the city, but also by the voice of the guide. The guide was not only informative but had a great tone and accent, it was a pleasant and enjoyable listening experience.

After the Freedom Trail, I took a short break and caught up with some friends from Germany. It was nice to connect with people from home and share stories, but also to catch up on some gossips.

The day wasn't over yet, so I set off on another long walk around Harvard and MIT, taking in the architecture and academic atmosphere. The institutions and students walking around with purpose and drive, was an inspiring sight. However, the campus was also a great place to find some cozy spots and enjoy the night.

## Summary

  <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
    "Es war ein weiterer Tag
In Boston's Straßen
Ich hatte geplant, "Beth" als meinen Reiseplaner zu benutzen
Aber aufgrund von Verbindungsproblemen
konnte ich es leider nicht so nutzen, wie ich es gehofft hatte

Ich begann, durch die Stadt zu schlendern
Ich entdeckte ein charmantes Diner und beschloss, dort zu frühstücken
Ich besuchte den Boston Common und andere Parks
Ich folgte dem ersten Teil des Freedom Trail mit einem Audio-Guide
Ich traf mich mit Freunden aus Deutschland
Ich machte einen langen Spaziergang um Harvard und MIT
Ich schlenderte im Dunkeln herum

Es war ein weiterer erstaunlicher Tag in Boston
Ich kann es kaum erwarten zu sehen, was der Rest meiner Reise bereithält" 
- Rammstein?

(Please note that it's my understanding that Rammstein's style usually contain heavy metal genre, which is characterized by aggressive, powerful and harsh musical elements, this text is my attempt to give a sort of summary of the post in German with a Rammstein's style but I couldn't be able to create a heavy metal song, and It's important to understand that lyrics of Rammstein are often in German, and often deal with controversial subjects such as sad, violent, sexual and political matters and imagery, as it may not align with the content of this summary post, which is more of an exploration and travel oriented.)
